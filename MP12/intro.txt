This program evaluates an expression in postfix notation (reverse polish notation) using trees. postfix(char * exp_str)is the top level function that when given an expression string will create the expression tree, evaluate the expression tree, print the solution, and then delete the tree. create_postfix_tree (char * exp_str will, given an expression string, create an expression tree. evaluate_postfix will, given a pointer to the root of a tree, traverse the tree and return the evaluated expression. Each node contains a character so if the character is a number it will be converted to a numeric value. delete_tree will, given a pointer to a tree, traverse the tree and delete it freeing anyallocated memory.
