This program implements a digital themed version of "snake". Two snakes play the game, a human snake controlled by the keyboard, and a computer snake controlled by a recursive algorithm. The game is played on a 2 dimensional grid of cells, where each cell is either 0, 1 or 2. Snakes can pass through 0s freely, and eat 1s for food, and cannot pass through 2s.
